# ChuckMcChuckface

Online Chuck Norris joke explorer

The core of the application can be found in the `Chuck` module (`./lib/chuck.ex`),
these functions connect core application logic (like the `JokesAPI`) to the web (`./lib/chuck_web/`).

The user authentication flow (mainly the `Chuck.Accounts.*` modules)
have been generated by phoenix using the `mix phx.gen.auth` command.

## Getting started

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Create the sqlite3 database using  `mix ecto.create`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
